# MEN Starter kit
The foundational setup to start a project using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.
This repository outlines the initial setup and essential boilerplate for building Node.js projects using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js), or MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

**Common Setup Includes:**
- **Express Server:** Manages routing and HTTP requests.
- **Mongoose:** Facilitates connection and interaction with a MongoDB database.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manages sensitive information such as database credentials.
- **Basic Server Setup:** Configures the server to listen for and respond to incoming requests..

After completing all the required steps as we covered in my repo "MEN-Starter-Kit" which includes:
- Create MongoDB Collections (Atlas Cloud)
- Adding Express Server file "server.js" with the default settings
- Defining Mongoose Schemas and Models
- Preparing Environment Variables
- Run and test Server Setup

### Step#1: Initiating the 'package.json' file
Navigate to your project folder, then use the "npm init" command to create a "package.json" file for your application. 
- With options:
```
npm init
```
- To skip the options:
```
npm init -y
```

### Step#2: Set Up Express
1. **Install Express**:
   To get started with Express, install it by running the following command:
```
   npm install express
```

### Step#3: Installing the "dotenv":
Use Environment Variables for Better Security: Store sensitive information, such as database credentials, in environment variables:
```
npm install dotenv
```

### Step#4: Installing mongoose
```
npm install mongoose
```

### Step#5: Creating the server JavaScript file:
By conventions:
- server.js
- app.js
- index.js

By using any from the following methods:
- Unix-Based Systems (Mac OS and Linux):
```
touch server.js
```

- Windows Command Prompt:
```
echo > server.js
```

- Windows PowerShell
```
New-Item -Path . -Name "server.js" -ItemType "file"
```
- File Explorer: Alternatively, you can manually create the file through the graphical interface of Windows.

### Step#6: Set Up MongoDB
We need to set up MongoDB to store and manage data
1. Install MongoDB
    - *Local Installation*: Download and install MongoDB from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). Please refer to my lecture PDF files for more details. You can also follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system as explained in MongoDB website.
    - *Cloud Installation*: Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database), a cloud-based MongoDB service. This is a convenient option if you prefer not to install MongoDB locally. Also refer to my PDF files for more details.


### Step#7: Create the .env File:
In your project root, create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection string:
You can copy the connection string:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
- Replace <username> with your MongoDB Atlas username.
- Replace <password> with the corresponding password.
- Replace <dbname> with the name of your database.

**Load Environment Variables:** Add the following line at the top of your server.js file to load the environment variables from the .env file:
```js
require('dotenv').config();
```

### MongoDB Atlas
1. Create a Cluster
  - Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and sign in or create an account.
  - Create a new cluster if you havenâ€™t already. Follow the prompts to set up your cluster.
2. Get the Connection String
- Go to the **Database Access**, create a user with read and write access to your database.
- Go to the **Network Access**, and add your IP address to the IP Whitelist to allow connections from your machine.
- In **Clusters**, click Connect and choose "Connect Your Application" to get the connection string.

## Step#3: Run and Test Server
- Start your Express server again to ensure everything is working:
```
node server.js
```
- Check the terminal for the "Connected to MongoDB" message to confirm that the connection is successful.


# Project Files Sequence:
### File1: dbconnect.js - MongoDB Connection File
This file is primarily responsible for establishing the connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

### File2: create.js - Simple create without Express

### File3: index.js - MongoDB Connection with Full Express Template
This file is primarily responsible for establishing the connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

- Adding the Express Template contents
- Adding the Environment Variable file with the required code for .env and in the server file
- Adding the initial code for "mongoose" besides Express template and .ENV variable as shown below:

**NOTES:**

- we can install all in one command:
```
npm install mongoose dotenv express
```

- we should also install ["nodemon"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as a development dependency:
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Then modify the "script" option in the package.json file:
```
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

**We can now proceed with CRUD operations**

# Our Atlas MongoDB:
- database: abc-college
- collection: "employees"
- one document sample:
```
{
  "_id": "6685c1acc3ce6380ffdd0004",
  "employee_id": "emp123",
  "name": "Alex Chow",
  "email": "alex@college.com",
  "position": "Instructor",
  "age": 58,
  "date_hired": "2024-07-03"
}
```
